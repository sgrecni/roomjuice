1. INTRO:
Room Juice is a multi-user jukebox web application.  So it's basically an 
mpg321 / madplay / ogg123 / mikmod / xmp / whatever front end.  It's designed
to be  simple to use and understand, and hopefully, not too difficult to
install. The main way to listen to the music is locally, but by using a program
such as darkice and icecast (listed below), you can stream the music to other
people as well.

I wrote it because all other jukebox programs out at the time seemed
inadequate in some sense or another, and I wanted something better, something
that I could improve upon.  Room Juice is developed under linux, but I don't
see why you couldn't use it on other flavors of unix.  A windows port wouldn't
be easy because of the code's reliance on command line utilities ( mpg321 /
mp3info / madplay / ogg123 / ogginfo / mikmod / xmp / locate ).  It's GPL'd
though, so do what you want with the code.

Basically you hit a web page, browse/search music files, add them to the
playlist, or remove them.  Hit play, the music starts.  Hit stop, the music
stops. Hit veto and the current song is stopped, a corny sound effect plays
(or doesn't if you wish), and music continues on with the next song.
The fun part is that you can give permissions by IP.  The default is to
give myself (192.168.1.*) absolute access; control of the music player,
add, remove songs, and veto.  While the rest of the world has access to
browse my music and add songs to my playlist. All of this can, of course,
be configured.

This application is great for multiple people in the same room (or irc channel
if you want to stream it).  The inspiration basically came from the movie
"Empire Records" where characters in the movie would play music, and each had
one veto a day.  Currently everybody has unlimited vetos, mainly because I find
the limitation of one veto a day annoying.  BTW, if anyone can record me a clean
sounding Empire Records "siren/scratch" sound effect, please do so! :)


2. REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
- web server, I use apache  - http://www.apache.org/
- php - http://www.php.net/ ( >= 4.2.0 recommended)
    - compiled as cgi version (you should have a "php" command)
       hint, compile php without telling it about your web server, and
       make sure to compile with --disable-magic-quotes
    - also interfaced with apache, either as static or a module
- one or more of the follwing: mpg321 / madplay / ogg123 / mikmod / xmp
- a web browser to access the app
- some MP3s, OGGs, or something :)

3. RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE:
- locate (for search and enqueueing features)
- mp3info/ogginfo (for extra cool features, deprecated, use taginfo instead)
- taginfo - http://grecni.com/software/taginfo/

4. REQUIRED HARDWARE:
- a computer
- a sound card
- some good speakers, or some cheapies if you happen to like banging your
  head against a wall.  I recommend the former.
- a human being in meatspace to listen, share & enjoy


5. SETUP:
- configuration options are in _config.php, please use the most recent version,
  as someone likes to change around the format of this file occasionally
- php-cgi should be installed. (you should have a "php" command)
- The web user must have read/write access to the "playlists" directory.
- The web user must also have access to /dev/dsp and /dev/mixer.  After much debate,
  this was by FAR the cleanest choice which means less code for me to write :)
- start up a web browser, point it at the roomjuice directory, and visit:
prefs->check config for errors for further setup and troubleshooting information.


6. LICENSE:
See the LICENSE file.  (GPL v2)
Most of the images directory is not GPLed.  I borrowed the button design
as noted in the credits.  I should probably replace the images, but I'm not
willing to give up pretty for free.  So I'll continue to use these until I
find acceptable free ones, or until the owner of said files complains.
