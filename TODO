Bugs
- pause/unpause, check to make sure the song got stopped/started as the process
could have been killed off by external means
- refuse to remove song if it's the one playing


Features I hope to add someday:
- add support for playing external music streams from a playlist
- be able to preset the volume for certain players (mods are quieter)
- move playlistcontrols.php to the main window?
- have queue.php log fatal errors, with a potential diagnosis?
- ability to click open up the containing directory of a file (in search)
- ability to move files up or down in the playlist
- voting mode ala Music Queue, have to record who voted somehow, insecure client side
  cookie, require a php session, or store server side somehow?
  data format for keeping the song "karma"?
- get rid of frames and do tables/divs and full "web 2.0" interface


Features I probably won't add myself, but might include if someone issues a good
patch that doesn't add bloat/needless complexity:
- Use an mp3 player that is controllable, actually issue real commands to
  so we can fastforward/rewind ala "mpg321 -R" mode.  Look into MPD?
- interface/wrapper for an existing command line CD ripping program


Features that I'm against adding:
- The capability to read your email.
- Store cached mp3 data in a database.   I think performance is pretty decent
  as it is, plus one of the goals of Room Juice is that it be easy to set up,
  requiring a database would make it increasingly more difficult to set up.
  If this was added, it would definitely have to be optional or very easy to
  setup.  Look into SQLite?


Features that have been implemented:
- add song to different favorites lists (from info screen)
- support id3v2 tags, tried getid3, too slow for many files, no other id3v2
  readers support fetching the time!?
